    "title": "A little more about me",
    "description": "My name is Shivang and I am an experienced software engineer and freelance developer. I have 7 years of experience building software on a variety of platforms for a multitude of projects. Since starting my career, I have worked predominantly as a server-side engineer developing the foundation for new products ranging from a real-time desktop streaming application to a web platform for shared workspaces used by thousands of users around the world. Having the experience of building out the technology at a startup and in a larger organization puts me in a unique position to be able to contribute in any situation. I have always been thrown into the fire and have always emerged from it as a stronger problem-solver and engineer."

    "description": "The skill that I pride myself most on is having the ability to quickly pick up and learn new technologies. At every stop I have been asked to go outside of my comfort zone which has enabled me to grow as an engineer. I have always felt at home working on small teams and having the ability to take ownership of my work to build new and interesting products. I am at my best when I not only get to help build a company and a product, but also collaborate with others and be a driving force that pushes the companyâ€™s vision forward. \n\nHere are some examples of languages, frameworks and other technologies I've learned over the years:"
